# Yolo-object-Detection
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. Unlike traditional methods that scan images multiple times, YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and object probabilities for each grid cell. This allows for faster and more efficient object detection.
